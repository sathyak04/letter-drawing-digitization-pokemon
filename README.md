# Who’s That Pokémon? 🎮

An AI-powered twist on the classic **Who’s That Pokémon?** game.  
Players handwrite letters, and a machine learning model predicts them in real-time.  
Correct predictions reveal the mystery Pokémon on screen.  
This project blends **nostalgia** with **modern AI**, combining handwriting recognition with interactive gameplay.
